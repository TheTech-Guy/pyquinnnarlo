  I'm a Computer Science Major, and I'm currently a student of The University of The People (UoP).
  Before majoring in Computer Science, I was a self taught Software developer and a mentor in programming and software development.
  I'm majoring in Computer Science because I want to study Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineering.
